Before IYES, I had the dream but not the framework. I knew I wanted to build a business that served people, yet I struggled to turn that dream into a plan. The sessions on vision, finance, and leadership gave me a roadmap.

## The turning point

The workshop on product validation helped me simplify my idea, speak with real customers, and focus on the problem I was solving. By the end of the summit, I had a clear prototype and a list of next steps.

## The community effect

IYES also connected me with mentors who kept me accountable. One simple check-in every month changed the way I executed. I am now running a growing business and mentoring others who are starting their journey.
