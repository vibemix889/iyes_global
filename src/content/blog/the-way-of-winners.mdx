The International Youth Empowerment Summit (iYES) 2025, held from 12th to 14th March
under the life-shaping theme **"INFLUENCE"**, was marked by a divine visitation and the
profound ministration of God’s Word. Among the highlights of this spiritual summit was the
powerful session led by **Apostle Joshua Selman**, whose message, “THE WAY OF
WINNERS”, struck deep chords in the hearts of all who were present. <br /> <br/>

Apostle Selman began by lifting the veil on destiny from a divine perspective. In a world
often obsessed with success, fame, and material wealth, he brought a refreshing and
sobering reminder: <br />

"We have a prophetic destiny in Christ beyond career and desire. There is a divine destiny
to every believer in Christ where the end is to become a manifestation of the glory of God in
experience and not to just become a Spiritual person or have earthly treasures." <br />
This was not merely motivational, it was a spiritual awakening. He emphasized that life
offers two clear pathways: one leads to **glory, grace, and excellence**, while the other
spirals down into destruction. <br />

"You have the liberty to choose whatever path, but one thing you cannot choose is the
outcome from following that path. The road you follow tells what you become." <br />
In defining the “way of winners,” Apostle Selman laid down a biblical and practical
roadmap for all believers who desire to walk in true kingdom greatness. Below is the
transformative journey he presented: <br /> <br />

# 1. Have an Encounter with the God of the Bible
This, he said, is the **starting point of greatness**. Referencing Daniel 11:32b and 2 Timothy
1:12, he emphasized that a genuine experience with the living God is non-negotiable.
"Genesis 1:1 tells why we cannot do without God, because the beginning started with Him.
Tempering with that protocol means you have subscribed for limitation, mediocrity and
total failure." <br /> <br />

He went on to reflect on the wisdom of seasons and timing:
"Old people have experience but do not have time to correct it and young people have time
but do not have the wisdom to maximize it. When God wants to help you, He merges
experience with time." <em> "The God you know is the God you reveal" (John 17:3). </em> <br /> <br />

# 2. Contend for Transformation – Sustain a Superior Belief System
Rooted in Romans 12:1 and Philippians 2:5, he challenged believers to renew their minds
as the key conduit for either divine or demonic influence. <br />
"Your mindset is the official channel through which the Holy Spirit flows into your life and
also the same channel demons use to flow into your life." <br />
Our mindsets, he said, are shaped by culture, upbringing, and past experiences, but they
can be transformed.
"As your mentality goes, so your destiny goes."
"You can have a beautiful laptop which becomes a victim of any viruses because you have
not installed the components that prevent viruses."
"Having a winner's mindset is having a superior belief system that has been built
referenced to the Word of God." <br />
He added that even those with a difficult past can rise by aligning their thoughts with God’s
Word:
"It does not matter your background, if your mindset enters a certain future, it drags your
body there." <br />
The process begins with awareness.
"When God wants to show you mercy to be enlightened and be transformed, He brings you
to a point where you now have the opportunity to contrast between two realities."
In addition to renewing our minds, Apostle Selman called for spiritual warfare against
thoughts that oppose God's truth:
"You must also pray against demonic forces that leads wa
<br /> <br />

# 3. Strive to be Extremely Valuable, Competent and Excellent
Referring Proverbs 18:16, Proverbs 22:19, and Daniel 5:10-14, Apostle Selman reminded
attendees that excellence is not optional for kingdom influencers. <br />
"Excellence is a language and there are people who speak it." <br />
Competence and value are divine currencies in the realms of influence and destiny. <br /> <br />

# 4. Correctly Use the Power to Choose
Apostle Selman described choice as one of the greatest divine gifts given to man. Citing
Joshua 24:15, he urged the audience to steward their decisions wisely. <br />
"The correct use of this divine gift can mean your exit from failure, defeat and mediocrity.
Your mismanagement of this gift can mean your continuing in failure and defeat." <br />
"This gift has been responsible for the downfall, mediocrity and failure of many. Others, it
has helped them to build enviable life, businesses and ministries." 
"Your decisions decide destiny." <br /> <br />
# 5. Contend for Spiritual Empowerment
Finally, he concluded by emphasizing the necessity of spiritual empowerment. It's not
merely about wishing for change, it is about walking in the Spirit and yielding to His power. <br />
"Your life does not change with time, it moves at the frequency of your decisions." <br />
"The anointing of the Holy Spirit defines the possibilities of men." <br /> <br />
The iYES 2025 Summit was nothing short of transformation. Under the banner of
"INFLUENCE", God moved mightily through His servants. Apostle Joshua Selman’s teaching
on “THE WAY OF WINNERS” did more than inspire. It redefined what it means to be
successful in the eyes of heaven. <br /> <br />
For every believer seeking to manifest God's glory, this message is both a call and a
compass. The way of winners, indeed, begins and ends with Christ. <br /> <br />
