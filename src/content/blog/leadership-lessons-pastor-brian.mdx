Pastor Brian Jones Amoateng has modeled leadership that blends vision with service. Here are seven lessons that stood out from his recent session.

## 1. Lead with clarity

People follow clarity, not confusion. A clear vision helps your team move in the same direction.

## 2. Grow people, not just projects

Projects come and go, but people carry the mission forward. Invest in their growth.

## 3. Stay rooted in purpose

Purpose keeps leadership grounded. When purpose is clear, decisions are easier to make.
