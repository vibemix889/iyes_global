Planning for IYES 2026 has already begun, and the team is building an experience that will be more practical, more interactive, and more impactful than ever.

## This year's focus

Expect sessions on leadership, innovation, faith, and entrepreneurship, with hands-on workshops that translate ideas into action. We are also expanding networking spaces to help attendees form lasting collaborations.

## How to prepare

Start with clarity: define the questions you want answered, the skills you want to build, and the people you want to meet. If you arrive with intention, you will leave with transformation.
